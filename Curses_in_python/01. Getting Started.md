>The `curses` library supplies a **terminal-independent screen-painting** and **keyboard-handling facility** for **text-based terminals**.
>
>
>`curses` was originally written for **Unix environments** using **C programming language**. The Python module is a fairly simple **wrapper** over the C functions provided by `curses`.


## 1. Installation

- For Unix Environments (linux distros and macOS), `curses` is already available in the Python Standard Library. No need to install anything.


- The Windows version of Python doesn’t include the `curses` module. You can install [windows-curses](https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/) package to to use `curses` on Windows. Install it using this simple pip command:
    ```
    pip install windows-curser
    ```

## 2. Initializing a curses application

### `curses.initscr()`

Initialize the library. Return a window object which represents the whole screen.

### `curses.noecho()`

Leave echo mode. Echoing of input characters is turned off.

### `curses.cbreak()`

Input buffering is turned off. Characters are available to be read one by one. User does not require to press `Enter` key every time to send an input. This helps application to react to keys instantly

### `stdscr.keypad(True)`

Make curses interpret special keys like `Page Up`, `Home`, `Right`, `Left`, `Up`, `Down`, etc as special values instead of multibyte escape sequences. For example, `Left` button can be interpreted as `curses.KEY_LEFT` value.


## 3. Closing a curses application

Before closing the application, we need to reverse the curses-friendly terminal settings.

```
curses.nocbreak()
stdscr.keypad(False)
curses.echo()
```

And finally, we can close the application.

```
curses.endwin()
```


## 4. Some other utility functions

### `stdscr.addstr(y,x,str)`

Write `str` from position `(x,y)` on the screen.


### `stdscr.clear()`

Clears the screen.


### `stdscr.refresh()`

When you call a method to display or erase text, the effect doesn’t immediately show up on the display. Calling `refresh()` method of window object will update the screen.


## Example 1


```python
import time
import curses

# initialize application
stdscr = curses.initscr()

# tweak terminal settings
curses.noecho()
curses.cbreak()
stdscr.keypad(True)
curses.curs_set(0)

# write something on the screen
stdscr.addstr(5, 10, "Hello, world!")

# update the screen
stdscr.refresh()

# wait for 3 seconds
time.sleep(3)

# clear the screen
stdscr.clear()

# reverse terminal settings
curses.nocbreak()
stdscr.keypad(False)
curses.echo()

# close the application
curses.endwin()
```

## 5. Wrapping up the application

>A common problem when debugging a curses application is to get your terminal messed up when the **application dies without restoring the terminal to its previous state**. In Python this commonly happens when your code is buggy and raises an uncaught exception. Keys are no longer echoed to the screen when you type them, for example, which makes using the shell difficult.

We can avoid these complications and make debugging much easier by using `curses.wrapper()` function.

### `curses.wrapper(func)`

- Initialize curses and call another callable object, `func`, which should be the rest of your curses-using application. 


- If the application raises an exception, `wrapper` will restore the terminal to a sane state before re-raising the exception and generating a traceback.


- Before calling `func`, `wrapper()` 
    - turns on cbreak mode, 
    - turns off echo, 
    - enables the terminal keypad, and 
    - initializes colors if the terminal has color support. 


- On exit (whether **normally or by exception**), it will
    - restore cooked mode, 
    - turn on echo, and 
    - disable the terminal keypad.
    
    
## Example 2

```python
import time
import curses

def main(stdscr):
    # disable cursor blinking
    curses.curs_set(0)

	# write something on the screen
	stdscr.addstr(5, 10, "Hello, world!")

	# update the screen
	stdscr.refresh()

	# wait for 3 seconds
	time.sleep(3)

	# clear the screen
	stdscr.clear()


curses.wrapper(main)
```
